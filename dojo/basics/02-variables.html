<h3>Variables</h3>
<h4>Do you remember Algebra from school?</h4>
<p>
	Do you remember Algebra from school?<br>
	In Algebra, you were able to assign a value to a letter. The letter
	was a representation of that value... and it's value could be modified
	through addition, substraction or other mathematic functions.
</p>
<pre class="javascript-code">
var x = 5;
var y = 4;

alert(x + y); // will alert 9

y++; // increase the value of variable y by one
alert(x + y); // will alert 10
</pre>



<h4>Declaring Variables</h4>
<p>
	In programming languages, the process of creating a variable is called <q>declaring a variable</q>.
	You can declare variables in JavaScript using the <strong>var</strong> keyword.
</p>
<pre class="javascript-code">
var x; // declaring a variable
var y = 5; // declaring a variable and assigning a value to it
</pre>



<h4>Local Variables</h4>
<p>
	A variable declared within a function becomes a <strong>local</strong> variable and can only be
	accessed within that function. The variable has a local scope.
</p>
<p>
	You can have multiple local variables with the same variable name in different functions, because
	local variables are only recognized by the function in which they are declared.
</p>
<h4>Global Variables</h4>
<p>
	Variables declared outside a function (scope) becomes <strong>global</strong> and all scripts and
	functions on the web page can access it.
</p>
<p>
	A variable declared without the <strong>var</strong> keyword will become a global variable by default.
</p>
<pre class="javascript-code">
function myFunc1(){
	var myVar = 3; // local variable
	alert(myVar); // 3

	myVar2 = 5; // global variable
}
myFunc1(); // calling first function

function myFunc2(){
	alert(myVar); // undefined

	var myVar = 4; // declare local variable
	alert(myVar); // 4

	alert(myVar2); // 5
}
myFunc2(); // calling second function
</pre>
