<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>
	JavaScript is a scripting language. That means, the code written in
	JavaScript needs an interpreter or engine that parses the code and
	provides a so-called host environment.
</p>
<p>
	The language JavaScript was originally invented by Brendan Eich in
	1995 and first released under the name <q>LiveScript</q> as part of
	the Netscape web browser.
</p>
<p>
	The core of the language JavaScript is standardized as ECMAScript
	(ECMA 262). It is described as a prototype-based object-oriented
	scripting language.
</p>
<p>
	JavaScript itself has many sugar in its syntax as you will find out later.
	You can use different design patterns, such as procedural or
	functional programming. You will also find out that there are many
	similarities to other languages, like to C, Java, Pascal, Scheme or
	even to Python or Perl.
